I was invited to lecture at the 2017 annual conference of the Classical Association of Canada, for the panel "Jobs Outside Academia, Aligning Classics with Today's Opportunities" (Chair: Cassandra Tran), May 10th. ((Program here)[https://www.cac-scec.ca/wp-content/uploads/documents/CAC2017_Schedule2.pdf].)

This lecture later evolved into the self-published essay ("An Affable Guide to Leaving Classics")[http://kyle-p-johnson.com/assets/kyle-johnson-affable-guide-leaving-classics.pdf] (September 5, 2017).
